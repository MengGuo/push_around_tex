\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
This work introduces a multi-robot approach for path clearing in unstructured environments, utilizing
a hybrid search algorithm to plan and execute the sequence of obstacles, contact points, and forces efficiently.
The framework demonstrates real-time adaptability to dynamic scenarios. Future work will address uncertainties
such as estimating obstacle positions without external monitoring, handling uncertain obstacle masses, and managing
partial robot visibility to improve robustness and performance in real-world, dynamic environments.
