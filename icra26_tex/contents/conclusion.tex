\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
This work presents a multi-robot framework PushAround for path clearing in unstructured environments using a
hybrid search algorithm that jointly plans obstacles, contact points, and forces with efficiency.
The method demonstrates adaptability to dynamic scenarios. Future directions include estimating
obstacle states without external sensing, addressing uncertain masses, and managing limited robot
visibility to enhance robustness in real-world environments.
