\section{Proposed Solution}\label{sec:solution}

The PushAround framework enables collaborative multi-robot pushing with physical 
feasibility. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:overall},
it first constructs a W-Clearance Connectivity Graph as described in 
Sec.~\ref{subsec:wccg}, which captures workspace connectivity and identifies 
blocking gaps. A gap-ranking strategy in Sec.~\ref{subsec:gap} then prioritizes 
obstacle-clearing actions, which are evaluated through a simulation-in-the-loop 
search in Sec.~\ref{subsec:simloop}. This search expands a configuration-space 
tree and validates pushes by parallel simulation. The overall flow and possible 
extensions are summarized in Sec.~\ref{subsec:overall}.
