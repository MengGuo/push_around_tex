\section{Proposed Solution}\label{sec:solution}

The unified framework called PushAround is developed to enable collaborative multi-robot pushing
with physical feasibility, as described in this section.
The framework begins by constructing a
W-Clearance Connectivity Graph, introduced in Sec.~\ref{subsec:wccg}, which
captures the connectivity of the workspace under the clearance requirement
and identifies frontier gaps that block passage. Building on this
representation, Sec.~\ref{subsec:gap} presents a gap-ranking strategy that
assigns costs to candidate gaps and determines which obstacle-clearing actions
are most promising. These ranked actions are then evaluated within a
simulation-in-the-loop search, described in Sec.~\ref{subsec:simloop}, where a
configuration-space tree is expanded and candidate pushes are validated by
parallel physical simulation. The complete execution flow together with
generalization aspects is summarized in Sec.~\ref{subsec:overall}.
