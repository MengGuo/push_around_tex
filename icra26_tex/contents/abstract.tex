\begin{abstract}
The passage of large vehicles in cluttered environments is often blocked by
movable obstacles, motivating the use of mobile robot teams to proactively
clear traversable corridors. Existing approaches to Navigation Among Movable
Obstacles (NAMO) mainly plan abstract sequences of obstacle displacements but
neglect physical feasibility, overlooking robot dimensions, obstacle mass,
contact geometry, and required forces, which often leads to strategies that
fail in execution. This work introduces {PushAround}, a
physics-informed framework that guarantees feasible path clearing by coupling
geometric reasoning with dynamic validation. The core novelty is a hybrid
search that jointly determines which obstacles to displace and how to push
them, including contact points, directions, and forces. The framework builds a
W--Clearance Connectivity Graph (WCCG) to test vehicle passage, ranks frontier gaps to
prioritize obstacle-clearing actions, and incrementally expands feasible plans
by validating pushing modes. This integration ensures that solutions are both
geometrically valid and physically executable. Efficiency is achieved by
combining compact geometric reasoning with prioritized evaluation, avoiding
exhaustive simulation and improving scalability.
Extensive simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate robust success,
physical validity, and efficiency.
