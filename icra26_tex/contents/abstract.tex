\begin{abstract}
In unstructured environments, the passage of large external vehicles is frequently
blocked by movable obstacles, which motivates the deployment of mobile robot teams
to proactively clear traversable corridors. Existing approaches to Navigation Among
Movable Obstacles (NAMO) primarily plan sequences of obstacle manipulations but
typically neglect physical feasibility, overlooking essential factors such as robot
dimensions, mass, applied forces, and the coupled dynamics of pushing. This
limitation often results in strategies that cannot be executed reliably in practice.
A physics-informed framework for collaborative multi-robot pushing is introduced,
enabling the active construction of physically feasible paths. The framework jointly
searches the sequence of obstacles to be displaced, the transit motions of robots
between obstacles, and the contact points and forces required for effective
execution. Core components include a W-Clearance Connectivity Graph (WCCG) for
reasoning about vehicle passage under width constraints, a gap-ranking strategy for
prioritizing obstacle-clearing actions, and a simulation-in-the-loop search to
validate push feasibility. Extensive simulations and hardware experiments
demonstrate robust success, scalability, and efficiency compared to baseline NAMO
methods.
